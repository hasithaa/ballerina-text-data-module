# Explaining the CSV format

In this file, the first line is the top-level header that provides the broadest context for the data ("Supermarket Sales"). The second line categorizes the data into "Store Information" and "Quarterly Sales". The third line provides further specification for "Quarterly Sales" by breaking it down into "Fruits" and "Vegetables". Finally, the fourth line provides the actual headers for the data columns.
